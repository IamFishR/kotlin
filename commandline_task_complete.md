‚óè Phase 1: Database Foundation - Complete!

  I have successfully completed Phase 1 of the command line implementation:

  ‚úÖ What was implemented:

  1. Database Entities (10 new tables):
    - CommandHistory - Stores all command executions with metadata
    - CommandOutput - Stores large command outputs separately
    - AIConversation - Tracks AI interactions with performance metrics
    - UserScript - Manages user-created automation scripts
    - SystemSnapshot - Captures system state at command execution
    - NetworkHistory - Tracks network operations (WiFi, Bluetooth)
    - AppAction - Logs app management actions
    - FileOperation - Records file system operations
    - DatabaseQuery - Tracks database queries for analytics
    - CommandUsage - Maintains command usage statistics
  2. Data Access Layer:
    - CommandHistoryDao - Comprehensive CRUD operations and analytics
    - AIConversationDao - AI conversation management with performance tracking
    - SystemMonitoringDao - System monitoring and script management
    - All DAOs include proper indexing and foreign key relationships
  3. Repository Layer:
    - CommandLineRepository - Unified interface for all command line operations
    - Helper methods for analytics, cleanup, and session management
    - Proper error handling and data validation
  4. Database Migration:
    - Migrated from version 13 to 14
    - Added all 10 new tables with proper foreign keys and indices
    - Maintained backward compatibility with existing data
  5. CommandPrompt Integration:
    - Enhanced CommandPromptViewModel with database persistence
    - Real-time command history saving to database
    - AI conversation tracking with performance metrics
    - Command usage statistics for autocomplete improvements
    - Database-backed command history navigation

  ‚úÖ Key Features Added:

  - Persistent Command History: All commands are saved to database with execution time, success status, and full context
  - AI Conversation Tracking: AI interactions are logged with performance metrics and user ratings
  - Usage Statistics: Command usage patterns are tracked for intelligent autocomplete
  - Session Management: Commands are grouped by session for better organization
  - Performance Monitoring: Execution times and success rates are tracked
  - Database-Backed Navigation: Up/down arrow navigation now loads from persistent history

  ‚úÖ Technical Improvements:

  - Proper Architecture: Clean separation between entities, DAOs, and repositories
  - Performance Optimized: Strategic indexing on frequently queried columns
  - Scalable Design: Prepared for future phases with extensible schema
  - Error Handling: Comprehensive error tracking and recovery
  - Memory Efficient: Large outputs stored separately to avoid memory issues

  ‚úÖ Build Status:

  - ‚úÖ Kotlin compilation successful
  - ‚úÖ APK build successful
  - ‚úÖ Database migration implemented
  - ‚úÖ Dependency injection configured
  - ‚úÖ All new entities and DAOs integrated
