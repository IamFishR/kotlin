# Advanced Command Line System - Implementation Plan

Think of it as a hybrid of a classic Linux shell, Android's ADB, and a modern AI-powered copilot.

## üéØ **Features Overview**

### 1. Advanced System & Hardware Interaction

Go beyond just displaying information and allow for direct control.

* **Network Management**:
    * `net scan wifi`: Scan for and list available Wi-Fi networks with their SSID, BSSID, and signal strength.
    * `net connect <ssid> --password <pass>`: Connect to a specific Wi-Fi network.
    * `net disconnect`: Disconnect from the current Wi-Fi network.
    * `bt scan`: Discover nearby Bluetooth devices.
    * `bt pair <device_address>`: Pair with a Bluetooth device.
    * `bt info`: Display detailed information about the Bluetooth adapter and connected devices.

* **Power Management**:
    * `power lock`: Lock the device screen (you already have a `SystemPowerManager` for this).
    * `power reboot --reason <reason>`: (Requires root/system permissions) Reboot the device.
    * `power battery`: Show detailed battery health, temperature, voltage, and charging status.

### 2. Deep Application & Process Management

Leverage your `AppRepository` to build powerful app management tools.

* **Application Control**:
    * `app list [--system]`: List all user-installed apps. The optional flag includes system apps.
    * `app info <package_name>`: Display comprehensive information about an app, including permissions, version, installation date, and signature.
    * `app launch <package_name>`: Launch an application.
    * `app kill <package_name>`: (Requires permission) Force-stop an application.
    * `app clear-cache <package_name>`: (Requires permission) Clear the cache for a specific app.

* **Permission Management**:
    * `perm list <package_name>`: List all permissions requested by an app and their current status (granted/denied).
    * `perm grant <package_name> <permission>`: (Requires special access) Grant a specific permission to an app.
    * `perm revoke <package_name> <permission>`: (Requires special access) Revoke a permission.

### 3. AI Copilot & Automation

This is where your CLI can truly shine by integrating the Gemma model as an intelligent assistant.

* **Natural Language to Command (AI Execution)**:
    * `ai "turn off wifi"`: The AI interprets this and executes the `net disconnect` command.
    * `ai "find all my photos from last week and move them to a new folder called 'Vacation'"`: A complex command where the AI generates and executes a sequence of file system commands.
    * `ai "create a rule to save all notifications from Slack that contain the word 'urgent' into the Work folder"`: The AI directly interacts with your Notes Hub rule engine.

* **Intelligent System Analysis**:
    * `ai analyze-battery`: Provides a natural language summary of battery usage, identifying apps that are draining the battery and suggesting actions.
    * `ai what's slowing down my device?`: The AI analyzes running processes and memory usage to provide a summary and recommendations.
    * `ai summarize my notifications for the last hour`: The AI processes recent notifications from your database and provides a concise summary.

* **Script Generation**:
    * `ai create-script --name "MorningRoutine" --actions "turn off dnd, set volume to 70%, launch news app"`: The AI generates a script file that can be executed later.

### 4. Full-Fledged File System Operations

A staple for any technical command line.

* **Standard Commands**:
    * `ls [-l] <path>`: List files and directories. The `-l` flag provides a detailed view (permissions, size, date).
    * `cd <path>`: Change the current directory.
    * `pwd`: Print the current working directory.
    * `mkdir <name>`: Create a new directory.
    * `touch <filename>`: Create a new empty file.
    * `cat <filename>`: Display the contents of a file.
    * `rm [-r] <path>`: Remove a file or directory (`-r` for recursive).
    * `cp <source> <destination>`: Copy a file or directory.
    * `mv <source> <destination>`: Move or rename a file or directory.

* **Advanced Search**:
    * `find <path> -name "*.jpg"`: Find all files matching a pattern.
    * `grep <pattern> <file>`: Search for a specific pattern within a file.

### 5. Development & Debugging Tools

Since you are a developer, these tools can be invaluable.

* **Logcat Viewer**:
    * `logcat [--grep="MyTag"]`: Stream the device logs (logcat) directly in the command prompt, with optional filtering.

* **Build & App Info**:
    * `build-info`: Display detailed information from your app's `build.gradle.kts`, such as `versionName`, `versionCode`, `compileSdk`, etc.
    * `dumpsys`: Provide a simplified, readable version of common `dumpsys` commands (e.g., `dumpsys battery`, `dumpsys meminfo`).

* **Database Inspector**:
    * `db query "SELECT * FROM notes WHERE folder_id = 'work'"`: Directly query the app's Room database.
    * `db schema <table_name>`: Display the schema for a specific database table.
